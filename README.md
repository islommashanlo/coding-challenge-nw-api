# Before starting the app, please download pull the "front-end" side of the app https://github.com/islommashanlo/coding-challenge-nw

After getting the backend and the fronted, do "bundle install", then "rails db:drop" -> "rails db:create" -> "rails db:migrate" and finally "rails s" on the Rails app. This will run the server side which also fetches external APIs.

After that you can run "npm install" and then "npm start" on the React app and you should be all set.


The app utilizes the TheMovieDB api, so if you cant access the information (without my API_KEY). You can easily get one on their website. 

Thank you and enjoy!
